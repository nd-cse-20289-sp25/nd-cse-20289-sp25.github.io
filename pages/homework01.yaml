  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you to practice manipulating
  files, redirecting I/O, constructing [pipelines], and signaling [processes]
  in a [Unix] environment.

  For this assignment, you are to do your work in the `homework01` folder of
  your **assignments** [GitHub] repository and push your work by **noon
  Saturday, January 25**.

  [Unix]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix
  [GitHub]: https://github.com
  [processes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)
  [pipelines]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)

  ## Activity 0: Branching

  As discussed in class, each **reading** and **homework** assignment must be
  completed in its own git [branch]; this will allow you to separate the work
  of each assignment and for you to use the [Pull Request] workflow describe
  in [Reading 01].

  To create a `homework01` branch in your local repository, follow the
  instructions below:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/cse-20289-sp25-assignments   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b homework01              # Create homework01 branch and check it out

      $ cd homework01                           # Go into homework01 folder

  Once these commands have been successfully performed, you are now ready to
  [add], [commit], and [push] any work required for this assignment.

  ## Activity 1: Adventure Guide (9 Points)

  The main activity for this assignment is to follow the prompts of your
  **Adventure Guide**, which takes the form of a program located at:

      https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/homework01/GUIDE

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-server"></i> Student Machines

  For this assignment, you will need to use the CSE **student machines** or any
  other machine with access to the [ESC] **NFS** filesystem.  This is because
  there are some resources that are only accessible via the [ESC] **NFS**.

  </div>

  You can use either [curl] or [wget] to download this program to your
  `homework01` folder in your **assignments** repository and execute it as follows:

      :::bash
      # Go to homework01 directory in assignments repository
      $ cd path/to/assignments/homework01

      # Download Adventure GUIDE
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/homework01/GUIDE

      # Run Adventure GUIDE
      $ python3 GUIDE
      ...

  As you can see in the demonstration video below, the `GUIDE` script will
  prompt you to complete a series of tasks (**19** in total).  After you
  complete each task, you must run the `GUIDE` script so it can verify your
  work.  If it detects that you have completed the task, it will update the
  `tasks.yaml` file with a specially encoded checkpoint payload associated with
  your **netid** and the corresponding task.  It will then prompt you with the
  next task.

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
    <script src="https://asciinema.org/a/R7Q35JcS718V5UNUliA34uGPF.js" id="asciicast-R7Q35JcS718V5UNUliA34uGPF" async="true"></script>
  </div>

  You are to follow the prompts specified by the `GUIDE` until you have
  completed each of the tasks in the adventure.  Because some tasks depend on
  others, there is no skipping ahead or going backwards.   That said, you can
  always remove the checkpoints in the `tasks.yaml` file to go back to a
  particular task.

  At the end of this activity, you should see the following output from the `GUIDE`:

      :::text
      $ ./GUIDE
      Checking homework01 tasks ...
       Task 00 Checkout on homework01 branch            ... Completed
       Task 01 Make GUIDE executable                    ... Completed
       Task 02 Copy file                                ... Completed
       Task 03 Extract archive                          ... Completed
       Task 04 Rename directory                         ... Completed
       Task 05 Remove archive                           ... Completed
       Task 06 Create empty file                        ... Completed
       Task 07 Redirection                              ... Completed
       Task 08 Append to file                           ... Completed
       Task 09 Edit file                                ... Completed
       Task 10 File size                                ... Completed
       Task 11 Disk usage                               ... Completed
       Task 12 Search file contents                     ... Completed
       Task 13 Search file names                        ... Completed
       Task 14 Sorting                                  ... Completed
       Task 15 Symlink                                  ... Completed
       Task 16 PID                                      ... Completed
       Task 17 Kill                                     ... Completed
       Task 18 Quiz                                     ... Completed
         Score 10.00 / 10.00
        Status Success

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Task Checkpoints

  Note, that each task checkpoint in the `tasks.yaml` is specially encoded for
  your **netid**.  This means that copying the checkpoint from another student
  or from a previous task will not work and will lead to a **corruption**
  warning that will anger the `GUIDE`.  The only way to proceed through the
  activity is to actually do the tasks!

  #### <i class="fa fa-bomb"></i> Kill The TROLLs

  The `TROLL` program is located at `/escnfs/home/pbui/pub/bin/TROLL`.  Before
  you log off the **student** machine you are working on, you should make sure
  you have **killed** all of your `TROLL` processes.

  </div>

  ## Activity 2: Adventure Quiz (1 Point)

  Once you have completed all the tasks specified by the `GUIDE` in **Activity
  1**, you are to complete the following *reflection quiz*:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework01.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework01/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To check your quiz directly, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking homework01 quiz ...
           Q01 0.20
           Q02 0.20
           Q03 0.20
           Q04 0.20
           Q05 0.20
         Score 1.00 / 1.00
        Status Success

  ## Just For Fun (Optional)

  For your own personal enrichment, you can read the following chapters from
  [The Linux Command Line]:

  1. Chapter 11 - The Environment
  2. Chapter 13 - Customizing the Prompt

  Once you have read these chapters, you can **customize** your [bash] shell
  prompt by adding useful information and colors and setting `$EDITOR` to your
  preferred text editor.

  Here are some additional resources to help you customize your [bash] shell:
