  **Everyone**:

  Next week, we will explore some basic [networking] utilities and then begin
  learning about [shell scripting].  That is, we will go from interactively
  controlling the [Unix shell] to utilizing the shell as a full-fledged
  programming language with variables, conditional statements, loops and even
  functions.

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

  The focus of this reading is some basic [networking] tools and an
  introduction to [shell scripting] in [bash].

  ## Readings

  The readings for next week are:

  1. [The Linux Command Line] (Tools):

      - Chapter 16 - Networking
      - <p>Chapter 17 - Searching For Files</p>

  2. [The Linux Command Line] (Scripting):

      - Chapter 24 - Writing Your First Script
      - Chapter 25 - Starting A Project
      - Chapter 26 - Top-Down Design
      - Chapter 27 - Flow Control: Branching With If
      - Chapter 29 - Flow Control: Loopning With While and Until
      - Chapter 30 - Troubleshooting
      - Chapter 31 - Flow Control: Branching With Case
      - Chapter 32 - Positional Parameters
      - <p>Chapter 33 - Flow Control: Looping With For</p>

      For a **shorter** version of the scripting chapters, you can read
      [Writing Shell Scripts] instead.  However, the chapters above are listed
      to serve as a reference should you need them (they do a more thorough job
      of explaining the material).

  ### Optional Resources

  The following are additional resources that you may find useful:

  #### Shell Scripting

  - [Shell Scripting Tutorial]
  - [Shell programming with bash: by example, by counter-example](http://matt.might.net/articles/bash-by-example/)
  - [Bash Guide](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide)

  #### Networking

  - [Introduction to Linux - Chapter 10. Networking](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/chap_10.html)
  - [Slackware Linux Essentials - Chapter 13 Basic Network Commands](http://www.slackbook.org/html/basic-network-commands.html)
  - [21 Basic Linux Networking Commands You Should Know](https://itsfoss.com/basic-linux-networking-commands/)

  A tool that will be demonstrated in class, but not assessed in the reading
    quiz or homework is [tmux], which is one of the **most game-changing**
    programs you could ever learn:

  - [A tmux Primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/)
  - [A Quick and Easy Guide to tmux](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)
  - [A Gentle Introduction to tmux](https://medium.com/hackernoon/a-gentle-introduction-to-tmux-8d784c404340)

  Although not required, it is **highly recommended** that you learn how to use
  [tmux].

  ## Quiz

  Once you have completed the readings, answer the following [Reading 02 Quiz]
  questions:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>

  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/reading02.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  ### Testing

  To verify the correctness of your `exists.sh` script, you should be able to
  reproduce the following:

      :::bash
      $ ls -l                               # List files in reading02 directory
      total 8.0K
      -rw-r--r-- 1 pbui pbui  23 Jan 18 15:39 README.md
      -rw-r--r-- 1 pbui pbui 144 Jan 28 13:37 answers.json
      -rwxr-xr-x 1 pbui pbui 254 Jan 28 18:02 exists.sh

      $ ./exists.sh * && echo Success       # Run script and check error code
      answers.json exists!
      exists.sh exists!
      README.md exists!
      Success

      $ ./exists.sh * ASDF || echo Success  # Run script and check error code
      answers.json exists!
      exists.sh exists!
      README.md exists!
      ASDF does not exist!
      Success

  ## Submission

  To submit your work, follow the same process outlined in [Reading 01]:

      :::bash
      $ git switch master                   # Make sure we are in master branch
      $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b reading02           # Create reading02 branch and check it out

      $ cd reading02                        # Go into reading02 folder
      $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

      $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Check reading02 quiz
      Checking reading02 quiz ...
            Q1 1.00
            Q2 0.50
            Q3 0.40
            Q4 0.30
            Q5 0.80
         Score 3.00 / 3.00
        Status Success

      $ git add answers.json                # Add answers.json to staging area
      $ git commit -m "Reading 02: Quiz"    # Commit work

      $ git push -u origin reading02        # Push branch to GitHub

  Remember to create a **Pull Request** and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 02 TA List].

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own **Pull Request**.  The TAs use open **Pull
  Requests** to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them
  yourself will cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
