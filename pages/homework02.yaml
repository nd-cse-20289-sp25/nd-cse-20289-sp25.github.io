  The goal of this homework assignment is to allow you to practice [shell
  scripting] and explore [networking] in a [Unix] environment.

  For this assignment, you are to do your work in the `homework02` folder of of
  your **assignments** [GitHub] repository and push your work by **noon
  Saturday, February 01**.

  [Unix]:               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix
  [GitHub]:             https://gitlab.com

  ## Activity 0: Pulling Changes

  Before starting this homework assignment, you should first perform a `git
  pull` to retrieve any changes in your remote [GitHub] repository:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/repository                   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Get any remote changes not present locally

  You will need to do this from time to time since the TAs will be grading your
  assignments and merging in your previous work.  To integrate these changes
  into your local repository, you will need to do a `git pull` to retrieve it
  from the remote [GitHub] repository.

  **Note**: If you get the following messages when you do a `git push`:

      ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
      error: failed to push some refs to 'git@gitlab.com/nd-cse-20289-sp25/cse-20289-sp25-assignments-pbui'
      hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
      hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
      hint: to the same ref. You may want to first merge the remote changes (e.g.,
      hint: 'git pull') before pushing again.
      hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

  Or:

      ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
      error: failed to push some refs to '...'
      To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
      Merge the remote changes before pushing again.  See the 'Note about fast-forwards'
      section of 'git push --help' for details

  This means you need to perform a `git pull` and merge in the remote changes
  before performing a `git push` as described above.

  Don't forget to create a new branch for this assignment:

      :::bash
      $ git checkout -b homework02              # Create homework02 branch and check it out

      $ cd homework02                           # Go into homework02 folder

  ## Activity 1: Meet the Oracle (6 Points)

  The main activity for this assignment is to follow the prompts of `MORPHEUS`,
  who takes the form of a program located at:

      https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/homework02/MORPHEUS

  You can use either [curl] or [wget] to download this program to your
  `homework02` folder in your **assignments** repository and execute it as
  follows:

      :::bash
      # Go to homework02 directory in assignments repository
      $ cd path/to/assignments/homework02

      # Download Adventure MORPHEUS
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/homework02/MORPHEUS

      # Make MORPHEUS executable
      $ chmod +x MORPHEUS

      # Run MORPHEUS
      $ ./MORPHEUS
      ...

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-server"></i> Student Machines

  For this assignment, you will need to use the CSE **student machines**. This
  is because `MORPHEUS` relies on some timing and networking features specific
  to the **student machines**.

  </div>

  `MORPHEUS` will lead you down the **rabbit hole** and guide you on your
  journey to meet with the [Oracle]:

  <div class="thumbnail text-center">
  <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbYirSi08m4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>

  Of course, access to the [Oracle] is heavily restricted, so you will need to
  use your [hacking] skills to locate her.  Once you connect with her, she will
  hopefully give you a message about how to use your **awesome Unix skills**.

  You are to follow the prompts specified by `MORPHEUS` until you have
  completed each of the tasks in the journey.  Because some tasks depend on
  others, there is no skipping ahead or going backwards.   That said, you can
  always remove the checkpoints in the `tasks.yaml` file to go back to a
  particular task.

  At the end of this activity, you should see the following output from the `MORPHEUS`:

      :::text
      $ ./MORPHEUS
      Checking homework02 tasks ...
       Task 00 Checkout on homework02 branch            ... Completed
       Task 01 IP of current machine                    ... Completed
       Task 02 IP of remote machine                     ... Completed
       Task 03 SSH hopping via jumpbox                  ... Completed
       Task 04 Measuring latency                        ... Completed
       Task 05 Scanning remote ports                    ... Completed
       Task 06 Find the DOORMAN                         ... Completed
       Task 07 Find your LOCKBOX                        ... Completed
       Task 08 Copy remote file                         ... Completed
       Task 09 Crack your LOCKBOX                       ... Completed
       Task 10 Contact the DOORMAN                      ... Completed
       Task 11 Retrieve MESSAGE                         ... Completed
       Task 12 Meet the ORACLE                          ... Completed
       Task 13 Quiz                                     ... Completed
         Score 10.00 / 10.00
        Status Success

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Task Checkpoints

  Note, that each task checkpoint in the `tasks.yaml` is specially encoded for
  your **netid**.  This means that copying the checkpoint from another student
  or from a previous task will not work and will lead to a **corruption**
  warning that will confuse `MORPHEUS`.  The only way to proceed through the
  activity is to actually do the tasks!

  ## Activity 2: Oracle Quiz (4 Points)

  Once you have completed all the tasks specified by the `MORPHEUS` in **Activity
  1**, you are to complete the following *reflection quiz*:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/homework02.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `homework02/answers.json` file.  You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  ## Just for Fun (Optional)

  For your own personal enrichment, can may customize your favorite `$EDITOR`
  by adding useful programming or development extensions and plugins that will
  make your [Unix] programming environment more productive. Here are some
  sources of inspiration:

      ...

  If you collaborated with any other students, or received help from TAs or AI
  tools on this assignment, please record this support in the `README.md` in
  the `homework02` folder and include it with your **Pull Request**.

  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">

  Remember to create a [Pull Request] and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 02 TA List].

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own [Pull Request].  The TAs use open [Pull Request]s
  to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them yourself will
  cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
