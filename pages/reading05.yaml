  **Everyone**:

  Next week, we will transition from [shell scripting] and [filters] to
  creating more sophisticated scripts using the [Python] programming language.
  Using a more advanced scripting language such as [Python] will allow us to
  use sequence data structures such as [lists] and mapping data structures such
  as [dictionaries], and thus perform more sophisticated data manipulation
  efficiently and effectively.

  #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

  The focus of this reading is to introduce scripting in [Python].

  ## Readings

  The readings for this week are:

  1. [Scientific Python Lecture Notes: 1.2. The Python
    language](https://lectures.scientific-python.org/intro/language/python_language.html)

  2. [A Byte of Python - Data
  Structures](https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html)

  ### Optional Resources

  Here are some additional resources:

  1. [A Byte of Python](http://python.swaroopch.com/)

  2. [Automate The Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

  #### <i class="fa fa-code"></i> Python 3

  In this course, we will be using [Python] `3.12+` and some additional
  libraries such as [Requests].

  On the **student** machines, you can use the instructor's copy of [Python] by
  making the following modifications to your `PATH` environmental variable:

      :::bash
      export PATH=~pbui/pub/pkgsrc/bin:$PATH

  This will give you access to a more current version of [Python] along with
  some of the libraries we will be using such as [Requests].

  To make this **persistent**, you should add this to the bottom of your
  `~/.bashrc` if you have not already.

  ## Quiz

  This week, your reading quiz is split into two sections: the first part is
  your normal [dredd] quiz, while the second part involves one [Python]
  script: `exists.py`.

  To test this script, you will need to download the [Makefile] and test scripts:

      :::bash
      $ git switch master                   # Make sure we are in master branch
      $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b reading05           # Create reading05 branch and check it out

      $ cd reading05                        # Go into reading05 folder

      # Download Reading 05 Makefile
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/reading05/Makefile

      # Execute tests (and download them)
      $ make

  ### Questions

  Record the answers to the following [Reading 05 Quiz] questions in your
  `reading05` branch:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>

  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/reading05.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  ### `exists.py`

  Use the `echo.py` script as the basis for a Python script called `exists.py`,
  which accomplishes the same task as the modified version of `exists.sh` in [Reading 02]:

      :::bash
      # Run script and check error code
      $./exists.py * && echo Success
      exists.py exists!
      README.md exists!
      Success

      $ ./exists.py * ASDF || echo Success
      # Run script and check error code
      exists.py exists!
      README.md exists!
      ASDF does not exist!
      Success

  #### Testing

  To test your `exists.py`, you can use the `test_exists.sh` script downloaded
  by the [Makefile]:

      :::bash
      $ ./test_exists.sh                    # Test your exists.py
      Checking reading05 exists.py ...
       exists.py                                ... Success
       exists.py *                              ... Success
       exists.py * ASDF                         ... Success
       exists.py ASDF * FDSA                    ... Success
       exists.py /lib/*                         ... Success
         Score 1.00 / 1.00
        Status Success

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### Hints

  - You will probably want to use [os.path.exists] to check if a file exists.

  - You will probably want to use [sys.exit] at the end of the script to return
    `0` if all files exist, otherwise return `1` any of the files does not
    exist.

  - You will probably want to use [string formatting] or [f-strings] when
    printing.

  [os.path.exists]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.exists
  [sys.exit]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit

  [f-strings]: http://zetcode.com/python/fstring/

  **DO NOT MERGE** your own **Pull Request**.  The TAs use open **Pull Requests**
  to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them yourself will
  cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
