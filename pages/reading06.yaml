  **Everyone**:

  Next week, we will explore a new programming paradigm called [functional
  programming], which, if you look closely, is similar to the [Unix Philosophy]:

  > By decomposing data processing problems into small functions that **work
  together** to process data without side-effects, we can expose opportunities
  for [concurrency] and [parallelism] to build powerful **abstractions** such
  as [MapReduce].

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

  The focus of this reading is to introduce you to common data formats such as
  [CSV] and [JSON], and then to let you explore [functional programming] in
  [Python].

  ## Quiz

  This week the reading is split into two sections: the first part is a short
  [dredd] quiz, while the second part involves a [Python] script: `odds.py`.

  ### Preparation

  To test this script, you will need to download the [Makefile] and test
  scripts:

      :::bash
      $ git switch master                   # Make sure we are in master branch
      $ git pull --rebase                   # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b reading06           # Create reading06 branch and check it out

      $ cd reading06                        # Go into reading06 folder

      # Download Makefile
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/reading06/Makefile

      # Download Skeleton Code
      $ curl -LO https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp25/static/txt/reading06/odds.py

  ### Questions (1.5 Points)

  Record the answers to the following [Reading 06 Quiz] questions in your
  `reading06` branch:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>

  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/reading06.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  As with [Reading 01], you will need to store your answers in a
  `reading06/answers.json` file. You can use the form above to generate the
  contents of this file, or you can write the [JSON] by hand.

  To test your quiz, you can use the `check.py` script:

      :::bash
      $ ../.scripts/check.py
      Checking reading06 quiz ...
            Q1 0.60
            Q2 0.40
            Q3 0.50
         Score 1.50 / 1.50
        Status Success

  ### Script: `odds.py` (1.5 Points)

  The `odds.py` script has four implementations of an `odds` function that
  processes a stream of input and returns a sequence of only the odd numbers.
  The first implementation, called `odds`, is provided to you:

      :::python
      def odds(stream=sys.stdin) -> list[int]:
          results = []
          for line in stream:
              number = int(line)
              if number % 2:
                  results.append(number)
          return results

  Your task is to implement the three other versions of the same `odds`
  function:

  1. `odds_fp(stream=sys.stdin) -> Iterator[int]`

      > This function uses [map], [filter], and a [lambda] expression to
      produce a sequence of only the odd numbers from `stream`.

  2. `odds_lc(stream=sys.stdin) -> list[int]`

      > This function uses a [list comprehension] to produce a sequence of only
      the odd numbers from `stream`.

  3. `odds_gr(stream=sys.stdin) -> Iterator[int]`

      > This function uses [yield] to generate a sequence of only the odd
      numbers from `stream`.

  #### Testing

  As you implement `odds.py`, you can use the provided [doctests] to verify the
  correctness of your code:

      :::bash
      # Run doctests
      $ python3 -m doctest odds.py -v
      2 items had no tests:
          odds
          odds.main
      4 items passed all tests:
         1 tests in odds.odds
         1 tests in odds.odds_fp
         1 tests in odds.odds_gr
         1 tests in odds.odds_lc
      4 tests in 6 items.
      4 passed and 0 failed.
      Test passed.

  You can also use `make` to run both the [doctests] and the [unit tests]:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests (and doctests)
      $ make test
      Testing Odds ...
      test_00_doctest (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_01_mypy (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_02_odds_fp (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_03_odds_lc (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_04_odds_gr (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_05_main_fp (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_06_main_lc (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok
      test_07_main_gr (__main__.OddsTest) ... ok

         Score 1.50 / 1.50
        Status Success

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ran 8 tests in 3.407s

      OK

  To just run the [unit tests], you can do the following:

      :::bash
      # Run unit tests
      $ ./odds.test -v
