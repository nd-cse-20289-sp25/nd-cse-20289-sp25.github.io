  **Everyone**:

  Next week, we will explore how to use some of the more advanced features of
  the [Unix shell], including how to manipulate [files] and control
  [processes], which are two fundamental abstractions the [Unix] operating
  system provides to the end user.  You are also encouraged to learn more about
  a particular text editor of your choice such as [vim], [emacs], or [nano].

  <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-search"></i> TL;DR

  The focus of this reading is to review the basics of manipulating files and
  processes in the [Unix Shell].

  </div>

  ## Branching

  As discussed in class, each **reading** and **homework** assignment must be
  completed in its own git [branch]; this will allow you to separate the work
  of each assignment and for you to use the [Pull Request] workflow describe
  at the end of this document.

  To create a branch in your local repository, follow the instructions below:

      :::bash
      $ cd path/to/cse-20289-sp25-assignments   # Go to assignments repository

      $ git switch master                       # Make sure we are in master branch

      $ git pull --rebase                       # Make sure we are up-to-date with GitHub

      $ git checkout -b reading01               # Create reading01 branch and check it out

      $ cd reading01                            # Go into reading01 folder

  Once these commands have been successfully performed, you are now ready to
  [add], [commit], and [push] any work required for this assignment.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> Branching off Master

  For the assignments in this class, you should always [branch] off the master
  [branch].  To determine which branch you are on, you can do the following:

      :::bash
      $ git branch

  To create and switch to a new branch, you can use the `git checkout -b
  BRANCH` as described above.  Once you have performed this command, you can
  check which branch you are on:

      :::bash
      $ git branch
        master
      * reading01

  To change to another existing branch, you can use the `git switch BRANCH`
  command.  Suppose you are on the `reading01` branch and want to switch back
  to the `master` branch.  To do so, you can do the following:

      :::bash
      $ git switch master

  Before switching branches, however, you may wish to [commit] your work or at
  the very least [stash] it.

  </div>

  ## Python 3

  Throughout the semester, we will be using [Python 3] for a variety of
  purposes.  Because the student machines an older version of [Python 3] by
  default, you will need to add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

      :::bash
      export PATH=/escnfs/home/pbui/pub/pkgsrc/bin:$PATH

  You can then source this file to load that environment variable:

      :::bash
      $ source ~/.bashrc

  To check that [Python 3] works, you can run the following:

      :::bash
      $ python3 -V
      Python 3.12.4

  This will be necessary for the `.scripts/check.py` script in your
  **assignments** repository.

  ## Readings

  The readings for **Wednesday, January 22** are:

  1. [The Linux Command Line]:

      - Chapter 6 - Redirection
      - Chapter 7 - Seeing the World as the Shell Sees it
      - Chapter 8 - Advanced Keyboard Tricks
      - Chapter 9 - Permissions
      - Chapter 10 - Processes

  In addition to reading the above chapters, it is recommended that you learn a
  command-line [text editor] such as one of the following:

  1. [nano]: This text editor is the easiest to get started with, but also has
  the least amount of features. It is what I recommend for newcomers to Linux.

      - [Using Nano](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/using-nano)
      - <p>[Nano Text Editor in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nano-text-editor-in-linux/)</p>

  2. [vim]: This text editor has many features such as syntax highlighting,
  plugins, and even spell checking. That said, it has a steep learning curve
  due to its foreign keyboard interface.

      - Chapter 12 - A Gentle Introduction to Vi of [The Linux Command Line]
      - <p>[Vim Editor in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/getting-started-with-vim-editor-in-linux/)</p>

  3. [emacs]: This text editor also has many features (perhaps too many). In
  fact, [Emacs] is so powerful, there is saying "Emacs is an excellent operating
  system. All it's missing is a decent text editor". **Bazinga!**

      - [How To Use the Emacs Editor in Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-emacs-editor-in-linux)

      - [An Emacs Tutorial: Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/beginners-guide-to-emacs)

  <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> This is my editor

  All joking aside, your exact choice in a [text editor] is not important.
  What is important, however, is that you become comfortable with at least one
  of them and are capable of editting text efficiently in terminal.  As the
  [creed] goes:<br><br>

  > This is my editor. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
  >
  > My editor is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
  >
  > Without me, my editor is useless. Without my editor, I am useless.

  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-magic"></i> VS Code

  If you are more comfortable using a graphical [text editor] such as [Visual
  Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then you should consider
  setting up [Remote development over
  SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial) and becoming
  familiar with its features including its builtin terminal emulator and
  debugger.

  That said, we do not recommend that you use the [git] integration or become
  too dependent on **AI** features such as **CoPilot**.

  ## Quiz

  Once you have completed the readings, answer the following [Reading 01 Quiz]
  questions:

  <div id="quiz-questions"></div>

  <div id="quiz-responses"></div>

  <script src="static/js/dredd-quiz.js"></script>
  <script>
  loadQuiz('static/json/reading01.json');
  </script>

  <pre style="display: none;" id="dr-container" class="codehilite"><code id="dredd-response"></code></pre>

  ## Submission

  To submit your answers, you will need to create an `answers.json` file in the
  `reading01` folder of your **assignments** repository:

  1. If you have not already, follow the instructions at the top of this
  document to create a `reading01` branch in your **assignments** [Git]
  repository.

  2. You can either hand-write the `answers.json` file using your favorite text
  editor or you can use the online form to generate the [JSON] data, which should
  look like the following:

          :::json
          {
              "q01": [
                  "stdin",
                  "stdout",
                  "stderr"
              ],
              "q02": "yes",
              "q03": [
                  "a",
                  "b"
              ],
              "q04": [
                  "a",
                  "b"
              ],
              "q05": [
                  "ls"
              ],
              "q06": [
                  "beastie"
              ],
              "q07": [
                  "beastie"
              ],
              "q08": [
                  "800"
              ],
              "q09": [
                  "b"
              ],
              "q10": [
                  "homeworks"
              ]
          }

      To determine which symbols correspond to which response, take a look at
      the [Reading 01 Quiz] file.

      To check your answers, you can use the provided `.scripts/check.py` script:

          :::bash
          $ cd reading01                        # Go into reading01 folder

          $ $EDITOR answers.json                # Edit your answers.json file

          $ ../.scripts/check.py                # Check reading01 quiz
          Checking reading01 quiz ...
               Q01 0.90
               Q02 0.10
               Q03 0.10
               Q04 0.10
               Q05 0.40
               Q06 0.10
               Q07 0.10
               Q08 0.30
               Q09 0.60
               Q10 0.30
            Score 3.00 / 3.00
           Status Success

      This script will check your responses by sending your
      `reading01/answers.json` file to [dredd], which is the automated grading
      system. [dredd] will take your answers and return to you a score and
      overall status as shown above.

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
      **Note**: The `Score` denotes how many points you received out of the
        maximum number of attempted points, while `Status` is `Success` if you
        have achieved full credit (otherwise, it will show `Failure`).
      </div>

      <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
      #### <i class="fa fa-repeat"></i> Try, Try, Try Again

      You may check your quiz answers as many times as you want; [dredd] does
      not keep track of who submits what or how many times. It simply returns a
      score.
      </div>

  3. Once you have your `answers` file, you need to [add], [commit] the file,
      and [push] your commits to [GitHub]:

          :::bash
          $ git add answers.json                # Add answers.json to staging area

          $ git commit -m "Reading 01: Quiz"    # Commit work

          $ git push -u origin reading01        # Push branch to GitHub

      <div class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
      #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Iterative Approach

      You may edit and commit changes to your branch as many times as you wish.
      Just make sure all of your work goes in the appropriate branch and then
      perform a `git push` when you are done.
      </div>

  4. When you are ready for your final submission, you need to create a
  [Pull Request] via the [GitHub] interface:

      - If you have a **Compare & pull request** button corresponding to your
        `reading01` branch on your repository page, then you can click on that
        button.

          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/reading01-github-compare-pr.png" class="img-responsive">
          </div>

          <div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
          #### <i class="fa fa-git"></i> Pull Request URL

          As an alternative, when you first do a `git push` on the
          command-line, [git] will also give you a **URL** that you can click
          to create a **Pull Request**.

          </div>

      - If you do not have the **Compare & pull request** button, then go to
        your repository's **Branches** page and then press the
        **New pull request** button for the appropriate branch:

          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/reading01-github-branches.png" class="img-responsive">
          </div>

      - Next, edit the **Pull Request** title to "Reading 01", write a comment
        if necessary, assign the appropriate **TA**, and then press the "Create
        pull request" button.

          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/reading01-github-pull-request.png" class="img-responsive">
          </div>

      - Every commit on [GitHub] will automatically submit your quiz or code to
        [dredd] and the results of each run is displayed in the **Checks** tab of
        each commit as shown below:

          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="static/img/reading01-github-checks.png" class="img-responsive">
          </div>

    Once you have made the **Pull Request**, the TA can verify your work and
    provide feedback via the discussion form inside the **Pull Request**. If
    necessary, you can update your submission by simply commit and pushing to
    the appropriate branch; the **Pull Request** will automatically be updated
    to match your latest work.

  <div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-life-ring"></i> Acknowledgments

  If you collaborated with any other students, or received help from TAs or AI
  tools on this assignment, please record this support in the `README.md` in
  the `reading01` folder and include it with your **Pull Request**.

  </div>

  <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
  #### <i class="fa fa-github"></i> Pull Request

  Remember to create a **Pull Request** and assign the appropriate TA from the
  [Reading 01 TA List].

  This list changes each week, so be sure to consult the appropriate list for
  each assignment.

  **DO NOT MERGE your own Pull Requests**.  The TAs use open **Pull Requests**
  to keep track of which assignments to grade.  Closing them yourself will
  cause a delay in grading and confuse the TAs.
